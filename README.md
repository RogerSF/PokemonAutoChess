COMP 4511 Project - Pokemon Auto-Chess

Game Play:
you can select cards to buy them using 'Gold' and place them onto the board to fight with waves of enemies. Three identical cards on the board evolves automatically into a stronger type when there is one and the more waves you win, the more gold you will receive.

Moreover, you could also use gold to 'Shuffle' and 'Update'. Shuffle, as the name suggests, generate a new set of cards at a cost of $3 and 'Update' operation increases your experience and the board_size accordingly at a cost of $5. 

Further development:
different combinations yields stronger defense / attack skills
expand the player & enemy card pool.

Basically I started the project from scratch and didn't include any external library. The graphics elements are downloaded mainly from https://hk.portal-pokemon.com/play/pokedex

The game is a variation of Dota Auto-Chess with Pokemon theme and I would never imagine I could finish a prototype like this before. Having gone through a series of challenges and sometime you just want to give up everything. However, after conquering them all and look back at it, I feel really lucky to take the class and it concludes my fantastic 5-year-stay at UST.
